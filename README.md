# Instructions

To use this tool, put it inside your SuperTools directory for Katana.

If this SuperTools directory does not exist yet:
1. create a SuperTools directory and move the entire tool directory inside it (ex: ./AlembicLoader)
2. add the SuperTools directory to your KATANA_RESOURCES path in your Katana launcher script

Once Katana is opened, you can access the tool through the appropriate node.
