A SuperTool is the easiest way to modify node structures dynamically as a result of user 
input and the best way to handle UI with PyQt. The AlembicLoaderEditor class (Editor.py) 
handles everything related to the UI, while the AlembicLoaderNode class (Node.py) takes 
care of the internal logic of the SuperTool, such as enabling/disabling loaded geometry 
and switching between versions. This division between UI and internal logic is fundamental 
to any scalable tool.
